Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
=================================================

*This is a CodeBook for my course project.* 

The 'UCI_HAR_tidy_data.txt' consists of mean and standard deviations of  following variables:

- X, Y, and Z axies of the following dimensions:
    - tBodyAcc
    - tGravityAcc
    - tBodyAccJerk
    - tBodyGyro
    - tBodyGyroJerk
    - fBodyAcc
    - fBodyAccJerk
    - fBodyGyro
- The magnitude of the following dimensions:
    - fBodyAcc
    - fBodyBodyAccJerk
    - fBodyBodyGyroJerk
    - fBodyBodyGyro
    - tBodyAccJerk
    - tBodyAcc
    - tBodyGyroJerk
    - tBodyGyro
    - tGravityAcc

Observations are grouped by 'subject' and 'activity' and mean of each variable is computed for each group.
